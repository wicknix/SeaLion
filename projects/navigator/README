SeaLion - Old School Styled Navigator for OS X 10.7 - 12.6
===============================================================================

SeaLion is a web browsing application forked from Mozilla community code that
is built using the Unified XUL Platform (UXP).

Its user interface is similar to SeaMonkey's Navigator/Browser component
which was derived from the Mozilla Application Suite developed largely by
Netscape for Netscape Communicator 6/7.
