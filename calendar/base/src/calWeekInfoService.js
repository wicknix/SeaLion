         * This implementation is based on the ISO 8601 standard.
         * ISO 8601 defines week one as the first week with at least 4
         * days, and defines Monday as the first day of the week.
         * Equivalently, the week one is the week with the first Thursday.
         *
         * This implementation uses the second definition, because it
         * enables the user to set a different start-day of the week
         * (Sunday instead of Monday is a common setting).  If the first
         * definition was used, all week-numbers could be off by one
         * depending on the week start day.  (For example, if weeks start
         * on Sunday, a year that starts on Thursday has only 3 days
         * [Thu-Sat] in that week, so it would be part of the last week of
         * the previous year, but if weeks start on Monday, the year would
         * have four days [Thu-Sun] in that week, so it would be counted
         * as week 1.)
