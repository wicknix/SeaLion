<!-- The old calendar extension, if it is installed in the same profile as
   - Lightning, will break Lightning because it ships several files that
   - have the same chrome address as files that Lightning ships.  This file
   - exists so we can check for whether that extension is installed and nuke it
   - in that case.  Note that this check *cannot* be done in any file that may
   - die as a result of the conflict (including messanger-overlay-sidebar.js).
   - Nor can it depend on files which may conflict.
